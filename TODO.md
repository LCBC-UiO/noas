# TODO

  * get metadata from files, for all non-core tables
    * general info:
      * long name
      * description?
      * last update?
    * column specific info:
      * type of data
        * currently "text" for all columns
        * idea: start with "float" in addition
      * long name
      * description?
  * support MRI tables (long_* with one additional columns for primary key)
  * fix date format in query results (currently datetime even for dates)
